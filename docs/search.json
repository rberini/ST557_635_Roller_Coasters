    "section": "Data Source and Collection Methods",
    "text": "Data Source and Collection Methods\nThe dataset was compiled from multiple authoritative sources specializing in roller coaster documentation. The primary data source was the Roller Coaster Database (RCDB), which claims to contain comprehensive information about all operational roller coasters worldwide. At the time of data collection, all operating US roller coasters according to RCDB were identified and included.\nDue to missing data values for several attributes in the original database, additional data sources were consulted to gather as much complete information as possible. These supplementary sources included:\n\nUltimate Roller Coaster\nCoasterpedia\nCoaster Grotto\nWikipedia\n\nThese sources all contain current information about roller coasters and are considered trustworthy and generally reliable sources within the roller coaster enthusiast community. Like the primary database, these sources provide current and mostly accurate information, though data quality should always be assessed when working with compiled datasets.\nThe data collection process involved significant data processing work, including organizing, structuring, cleaning, and transforming the raw information to create a usable analytical dataset."
